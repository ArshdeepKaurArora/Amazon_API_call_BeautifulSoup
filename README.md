# Amazon_API_call_BeautifulSoup

This is an automation project to collect the data(price of product) from the Amazon website using BeautifulSoup.

## What does the project do?

`BeautifulSoup` and `requests` package helps to collect data on Amazon products from the Amazon website(I have looked for an electric pressure cooker).

If the price of an Amazon product is lower than my limit of expenditure on the same, then using `smptlib` package an email is dropped on my email account with the price information and link to the Amazon page with the product.
